>My device is called Ninkbox N1 Max RK3318. I was trying to look for a firmware suitable for my device but I am unable to find the exact one. I tried asking support from their main website but to no avail. So I tried installing different firmware on my device with almost the same chips until I ended up bricking the device. Unfortunately I already bricked the device before landing into this post so I was not able to backup my original firmware. For some unfortunate twist of fate I also have those BGA chips with no exposed pins. Upon further examination there are two round copper at the back of the board where the BGA chip sits. After burning the image on an SD card I tried shorting the round coppers with a piece of staple wire and it gave me the Multiboot window.
