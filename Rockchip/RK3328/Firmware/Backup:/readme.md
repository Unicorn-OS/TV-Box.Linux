>*Posted September 24, 2022*
>I was trying to flash the eMMC of my X88 PRO 10, which bricked it. I need some help to unbrick it.

>So far, I have managed to put it into maskrom mode by conneting the two contact pads in the red circles and pluging in a USB A to A cable in the USB 2.0 port of the tv box and my computer.
>I took a backup of the firmware with the multitool from here: https://forum.armbian.com/topic/17597-csc-armbian-for-rk3318rk3328-tv-box-boards/page/1 but I could not find a way to restore it.
>I tried Android tool reports, which says "Found One MASKROM Device", but threw an error when I tried to load my backup.
>So I searched for the origional firmware, but could not find a source that was working.
>Can someone help me unbricking my TV box?
