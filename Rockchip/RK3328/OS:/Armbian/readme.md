# Unbrick:
>Technically, rockchip devices cannot be bricked. If the internal flash does not contain a bootable system, they will always boot from the sdcard. If, for a reason, the bootable system on the internal flash is corrupted or is unable to boot correctly, you can always force the maskrom mode shorting the clock pin on the PCB. The procedure is explained [here](https://forum.armbian.com/topic/12656-csc-armbian-for-rk322x-tv-boxes/page/5/#comment-99167) for rk322x, but for rk3318/28 is the same.
